# Working on Backtracking Algorithms.
There are three files regarding the Algorithms
1. Backtracking --> Implemented Naive Backtracking
2. Backjumping --> Implemented backjumping Algorithm
3. Conflictbackjumping --> Implemented Conflict-directed Backjumping Algorithm.

All the code is implemented in Python 3 

command for running the code is 

python3 xxxx.py
Enter the size of the board
